Pandaemonium,Pandaemonium,,"Set in England during the early 19th century, Pandaemonium evokes late-1960s America in its depiction of the relationship between Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Linus Roach) and William Wordsworth (John Hannah). Instead of going to Vietnam, Wordsworth goes off to fight against the French while Coleridge stays at home and promotes utopianism. After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.","['Drama', 'Foreign']","['Linus Roache', 'John Hannah', 'Samantha Morton']",Julien Temple,[],en,0.165367,['Arts Council of England'],['United Kingdom'],2001-06-29,0,124.0,['English'],Released,0,4.5,2,

Inside Deep Throat,Inside Deep Throat,It was filmed in 6 days for 25 thousand dollars. The government didn't want you to see it. It was banned in 23 states. It has grossed over 600 million dollars. And it is the most profitable film in motion picture history.,"In 1972, a seemingly typical shoestring budget pornographic film was made in a Florida hotel, ""Deep Throat,"" starring Linda Lovelace. This film would surpass the wildest expectation of everyone involved to become one of the most successful independent films of all time. It caught the public imagination which met the spirit of the times, even as the self appointed guardians of public morality struggled to suppress it, and created, for a brief moment, a possible future where sexuality in film had a bold artistic potential. This film covers the story of the making of this controversial film, its stunning success, its hysterical opposition along with its dark side of mob influence and allegations of the on set mistreatment of the film's star. In short, the combined events would redefine the popular appeal of pornography, even as more cynical developments would lead it down other paths.","['History', 'Documentary']","['Dennis Hopper', 'Peter Bart', 'Warren Beatty']",Fenton Bailey,"['usa', '1970s', 'sexual revolution', 'unsimulated sex']",en,3.980072,[],['United States of America'],2005-02-11,653621,92.0,['English'],Released,2000000,6.8,31,
